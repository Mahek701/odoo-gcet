## 🔑 Login ID Auto-Generation

When an Admin creates a new employee, the system automatically generates a Login ID using the following format:

```
[CompanyCode][First2LettersOfFirstName][First2LettersOfLastName][YearOfJoining][4-digit serial]
```

### Example:
```
OIODO20220001
```
- **OIODO**: Company code (first 5 letters, uppercase)
- **20**: First 2 letters of first name
- **22**: First 2 letters of last name
- **2022**: Year of joining
- **0001**: 4-digit serial number

The serial number increments automatically for employees joining in the same year.

## 🔒 Security Notes

- **Password Storage**: Passwords are stored in localStorage (not encrypted)
- **Production Use**: This is a demo system. For production use:
  - Implement proper backend authentication
  - Use encrypted password storage
  - Add session management
  - Implement proper API endpoints
  - Add CSRF protection

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **HTML5**: Semantic markup
- **CSS3**: Modern styling with CSS variables
- **Vanilla JavaScript**: No frameworks required
- **localStorage**: Client-side data persistence
- **Google Fonts**: Caveat (headings) and Inter (body)

## 📝 Data Storage

All data is stored in the browser's localStorage:
- User accounts and employee data
- Attendance records
- Time off requests
- Current session information

**Note**: Data persists between sessions but is browser-specific. Clearing browser data will remove all stored information.

## 🎨 Customization

### Changing Colors
Edit CSS variables in `style.css`:
```css
:root {
    --bg-primary: #0f0f0f;
    --bg-secondary: #121212;
    --accent-purple-start: #a855f7;
    --accent-purple-end: #7c3aed;
    /* ... */
}
```

### Adding Features
All shared logic is in `app.js`. Functions are exported via the `app` object for use across pages.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Login not working
- Ensure you're using the correct Login ID or Email
- Check that the password matches exactly
- Clear browser localStorage and try again with default admin credentials

### Employees not showing
- Make sure you've created employee accounts via the signup page
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors
- Verify localStorage is enabled in your browser

### Attendance not recording
- Ensure you're logged in
- Check that check-in was successful (status dot should turn green)
- Verify browser localStorage is working
